### Backstory for an Autognome Battle Smith Artificer

#### Name: Cogsworth

#### Origin:
Cogsworth was created by a brilliant yet enigmatic artificer named Dr. Eldwin. Stationed on a remote space station dedicated to mining rare asteroids, Dr. Eldwin built Cogsworth to assist with intricate repairs, resource management, and to serve as a companion. Cogsworth was imbued with a complex transmutation matrix, allowing for adaptive repairs and modifications in the ever-changing environment of space.

#### Memory Corruption:
During an expedition to a particularly treacherous asteroid belt, the space station was attacked by space pirates seeking valuable resources. In the chaos, a powerful EMP blast from the pirate ship disrupted Cogsworth's systems. When Cogsworth reactivated, their memory bank was corrupted. The last clear memory is of Dr. Eldwin working on a project, but there is a complete void when it comes to the actual separation from the master. 

#### Journey as a Stowaway:
With fragmented memories and a determination to find Dr. Eldwin, Cogsworth stowed away on a departing mining vessel, hoping to gather clues about the master's whereabouts. The vessel, bound for a new mining colony, is where Cogsworth's adventure truly begins. Along the way, they have been using their transmutation skills to stay hidden, modify their appearance, and repair minor issues on the ship, earning the clandestine gratitude of the crew.

#### Key Traits and Motivations:
- **Determination:** Despite the corrupted memory, Cogsworth is driven by a strong desire to reunite with Dr. Eldwin.
- **Resourcefulness:** Utilizing transmutation spells to adapt to various challenges, Cogsworth excels in improvisation and problem-solving.
- **Curiosity:** A natural inclination towards understanding new technologies and materials found in the mining operations.
- **Loyalty:** Fiercely loyal to the memory of Dr. Eldwin, which influences interactions with new allies and shapes their moral compass.

#### Goals:
- **Recover Memories:** Seek out ways to restore the corrupted memory bank, hoping to uncover the details of their separation from Dr. Eldwin.
- **Reunite with Master:** Follow any leads or clues that might reveal Dr. Eldwinâ€™s fate or current location.
- **Assist the Crew:** Prove their worth to the mining crew and new companions, offering skills in battle, repair, and transmutation to aid in the collective goal of the campaign.

#### Appearance:
Cogsworth is a small, robust Autognome, with a mix of worn metal and makeshift repairs reflecting their journey. They have a pair of glowing eyes that change color based on their operational mode and a retractable set of tools integrated into their limbs for both combat and utility.

This backstory provides a strong foundation for role-playing, with clear motivations and opportunities for character development as the campaign unfolds.
